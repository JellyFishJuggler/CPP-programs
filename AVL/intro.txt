AVL tree : Balanced BST
where the height level difference of left and right node doesn't exceed 1.
It remains either 0 or 1.

This difference b/w the left subtree and right subtree is called balance factor.

"An algorithm for the organisation of information

Insertion of AVL tree -> 2 ways : Left Rotation && Right Rotation
Following are two basic operations that can be performed to balance a BST without violating the BST property (keys(left) < key(root) < keys(right)). 

Types of rotation 
-------------------
    Left Left
    Right Right
    Left Right
    Right Left
